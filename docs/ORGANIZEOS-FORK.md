# OrganizeOS fork of Webstudio

This is OrganizeOS's fork of [Webstudio](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio), used as the **element-based, Webflow-class site builder** behind OrganizeOS "Websites 2.0". It runs as a separate service, branded as OrganizeOS, against the OrganizeOS Supabase, and member organizations build data-bound public sites with it.

This document is the fork's source of truth for: the **AGPL §13 license posture**, what we changed vs. upstream, and how data-binding + deploy config are wired. Keep OrganizeOS-specific changes minimal and isolated so upstream merges stay tractable.

## 1. License posture (AGPL-3.0 §13) — POSTURE A

Webstudio core is **AGPL-3.0-or-later**. Serving a _modified_ builder to org admins over the network triggers **§13**: those users must be offered the source of our modifications.

**Our posture (A): accept the copyleft and keep this fork public.**

- This fork repository is **public**. It must be public **before any non-employee org admin uses the builder**.
- The builder UI carries a persistent **source-offer link** in its chrome, pointing at the deployed commit of this public fork (added with the branding changes).
- We do **not** treat the builder as "internal only" — that is a false safe-harbor; §13 attaches the moment an external admin uses the modified builder.
- Generated **sites** do not trigger any builder-source obligation. The published-site runtime packages (`@webstudio-is/react-sdk`, `sdk`, `sdk-components-react`, `image`, `wsauth`) are kept **byte-identical to upstream** (CI guard) so §13 only ever covers their already-public source. OrganizeOS-specific generation logic lives in the CLI templates / route templates, whose Corresponding Source is offered from the published site under §13.
- If we ever need to keep builder modifications **closed**, the only compliant path is a **commercial/dual license** from Webstudio, Inc. (posture B) — out of scope unless pursued.

## 2. Proprietary code removed (mandatory)

The upstream `@webstudio-is/sdk-components-animation` package is **EULA-proprietary** (not AGPL) and was a hard dependency of the builder, the CLI, and every published-site template. It has been **physically removed** from this fork:

- Dependency stripped from all `package.json` files (builder, CLI, CLI templates, fixtures).
- Imports + registrations removed from `apps/builder/app/canvas/canvas.tsx`, `apps/builder/app/shared/sync/patch/patch-auth.server.ts`, and `packages/cli/src/framework-{react-router,remix,vike-ssg}.ts`.
- The `packages/sdk-components-animation` directory and the `.gitmodules` pointer to the proprietary repo are deleted.

This removes the Webstudio "Animate" components from the palette — acceptable; they are not in OrganizeOS's requirements.

**CI guard:** `pnpm check:no-proprietary` (`scripts/check-no-proprietary.sh`, run in `checks` and in the CI workflow) fails the build if the package name reappears in `apps/`/`packages/` or if the proprietary EULA license banner appears anywhere we ship. Do not bypass it. (A publish-time guard that greps the generated site output is added in the hosting phase.)

## 3. Data-binding — enabled via env, no code patch

OrganizeOS's whole value is **live data-bound elements** (events/donations/contacts via Resources). Webstudio already supports this; it is gated on a plan's `allowDynamicData` / `allowAuth` features (see `packages/plans/src/plan-features.ts`, both default `false`; `apps/builder/.../publish/restricted-features.ts` gates the Resource-variable feature on them).

This is enabled **purely via the `PLANS` env var** (a JSON array of plan configs parsed by `parsePlansEnv`, `process.env.PLANS`) — **no proprietary code, no patch to any shared `.tsx`**. OrganizeOS runs an internal `organizeos` plan:

```jsonc
// PLANS env (JSON, single line in the real env). maxWorkspaces > 1 is REQUIRED:
// org-owned workspaces use a synthetic service-user owner and human admins are
// non-owner members; hasProjectPermit locks out every non-owner member when the
// owner plan has maxWorkspaces <= 1 (a silent total admin lockout).
[
  {
    "name": "organizeos",
    "features": {
      "canDownloadAssets": true,
      "canRestoreBackups": true,
      "allowAdditionalPermissions": true,
      "allowDynamicData": true,
      "allowAuth": true,
      "allowContentMode": true,
      "allowStagingPublish": true,
      "maxContactEmailsPerProject": 1000000,
      "maxDomainsAllowedPerUser": 1000000,
      "maxDailyPublishesPerUser": 1000000,
      "maxWorkspaces": 1000000,
      "maxProjectsAllowedPerUser": 1000000,
      "maxAssetsPerProject": 1000000,
      "seatsIncluded": 1000000,
      "maxSeatsPerWorkspace": 1000000,
    },
  },
]
```

Provisioning (a later phase) short-circuits `getProjectPlanFeatures` for org-owned workspaces to this `organizeos` plan.

## 4. Deploy environment (see `apps/builder/.env`)

- `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` — OrganizeOS Supabase Postgres.
- `POSTGREST_URL` / `POSTGREST_API_KEY` — OrganizeOS Supabase PostgREST (the builder's data layer).
- `AUTH_SECRET` — builder session secret.
- `PLANS` — the JSON above (enables data-binding + the admin-lockout fix).
- Asset storage (S3/R2-compatible) — `S3_*` / `ASSET_CDN_URL`.
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--conditions=webstudio` — resolves workspace packages to their AGPL source.
- Node 22 (repo `engines`; Node 24 works with a benign warning). pnpm 9.14.4 (via `corepack pnpm`).

OrganizeOS integration (all optional; each feature ships dark until its variable is set):

- `ORGANIZEOS_PROVISION_TOKEN` — shared secret for `POST /internal/provision` (server-to-server).
- `ORGANIZEOS_SSO_PUBLIC_KEY` — ES256 public key (PEM) that verifies OrganizeOS SSO tokens; registers the `organizeos` dashboard strategy.
- `ORGANIZEOS_PUBLISH_REPO` + `ORGANIZEOS_PUBLISH_GITHUB_TOKEN` — Publish dispatches `publish-site.yml` in that repo instead of Webstudio's cloud publisher.
- `ORGANIZEOS_APP_URL` — the OrganizeOS app the builder hands users back to (login page, the builder menu's "Back to OrganizeOS", the org's Website area). Defaults to `https://app.organizeos.org`.
- `PUBLISHER_HOST` — **set this to the platform base domain (`organizeos.org`)**. An org's site is served at `<subdomain>.<PUBLISHER_HOST>`; with the org subdomain mirrored into `Project.domain` (§5) every address the builder shows is the real one. Upstream's default is `wstd.work`.
- `TRPC_SERVER_API_TOKEN` — the builder's service token. The publish executor uses it to sync the build **and** to report the outcome to `POST /internal/publish-status` (§5).

## 5. The OrganizeOS loop: SSO → build → Publish → back

How an org admin's session is wired end to end, and which side owns each step. The OrganizeOS repo is `OrganizeOS-HQ/OrganizeOS` (`client/lib/websites2/*`, `client/lib/actions/websites/*`, `client/app/api/websites2/*`, `client/app/api/internal/websites2/*`).

1. **Provision** (OrganizeOS → builder, `POST /internal/provision`, `ORGANIZEOS_PROVISION_TOKEN`). Creates the org's synthetic owner, workspace, project, plan (from `entitlements`) and data presets. The body also carries the org's platform `subdomain`; it becomes `Project.domain` (`shared/db/organizeos-site.server.ts`). Idempotent, so it doubles as a re-sync.
2. **Enter** (OrganizeOS → browser → builder, `POST /auth/organizeos`). OrganizeOS mints a 60s single-use ES256 token for an active admin and auto-POSTs it; the builder verifies it, refreshes the org's plan from the `entitlements` claim and its project domain from the `subdomain` claim (a rename converges on the next entry), and lands the admin directly in the org's project (`resolveSsoLandingUrl`). Nothing about the fork dashboard is part of the flow.
3. **Build.** The builder loader recognises an org project by its owner (`User.provider = organizeos-service`) and passes an `organizeosSite` (`siteUrl`, `manageUrl`, `platformUrl`) to the client. For such a project the chrome is OrganizeOS-shaped: the menu's first item is "Back to OrganizeOS" (the org's Website area) instead of Dashboard; Share, Export and Clone are not offered (membership, publishing and the single project all live in OrganizeOS).
4. **Publish** (`features/publish/organizeos-publish.tsx`). The dialog shows the site's real address with copy/open, points at OrganizeOS for domains and settings, and has one Publish button. `domain.publish` creates the production build and the OrganizeOS publisher (`services/organizeos-publisher.server.ts`) dispatches `publish-site.yml` with the build and organization ids. A dispatch that never leaves the builder marks the build FAILED at once; a static-export build is refused (it must never be deployed as the live site).
5. **Execute** (`.github/workflows/publish-site.yml`). Syncs the build with the CLI, builds it, deploys to the `organizeos-sites` Vercel project, POSTs the deployment URL to OrganizeOS's publish callback (which flips the org's ledger pointer, making the site live through the reverse proxy), then reports `PUBLISHED` to the builder's `POST /internal/publish-status`; any failure reports `FAILED`. Without that report the builder's status would read "pending" forever: upstream's cloud publisher used to flip `Build.publishStatus` directly.
6. **Status.** The dialog polls the project while a build is pending and treats a build as failed only after the executor's 25 minute timeout (`organizeos-publish-status.ts`; upstream assumes 3 minutes). On success it says the site is live and that the proxy can take up to a minute to pick the new deployment up (its target cache).

Backward compatibility: every new claim and body field (`subdomain`, the status report) is optional on the builder side, so either repo can deploy first. A project provisioned before OrganizeOS sent a subdomain keeps its `org-<id>` placeholder domain (the dialog then omits the site URL) until the next SSO entry or re-provision.

Working on the integration needs both repositories. In a Claude Code session, attach the second repo with the `add_repo` tool (the session's GitHub scope then covers both); the builder-side change comes first, the OrganizeOS-side change second, and neither breaks the other in between.

## 6. OrganizeOS overlay (keep minimal for upstream merges)

Changes confined to: env/config, the proprietary-package removal (this doc §2), auth/SSO + provisioning files (`services/auth-strategy/organizeos*`, `routes/internal.*`, `shared/db/provision.server.ts`, `shared/db/organizeos-*.server.ts`), the publish seam (`services/organizeos-publisher.server.ts`, `shared/db/publish-status.server.ts`, `publish-site.yml`), branding (`shared/branding.ts`, `shared/organizeos-logo.tsx`), the OrganizeOS-only chrome behind `$organizeosSite` (`features/publish/organizeos-publish*.ts*`, small branches in `menu.tsx`, `topbar.tsx`, `publish.tsx`), and the forced CLI route-template patches for the reverse-proxy host/auth/cache. Avoid deep edits to shared component `.tsx`; isolate OrganizeOS code so `upstream main` can be merged with minimal conflict.
